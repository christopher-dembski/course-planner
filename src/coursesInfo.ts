        "description": "The objectives of 1012 are threefold: providing a first exposure to event-driven programming, teaching students a set of computing skills (including reasoning about algorithms, tracing programs, test-driven development, unit testing), and providing an introduction to computing within a mobile, net-centric context. It uses problem-based approach to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. A mature mobile software infrastructure (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is used so that students can pick up key programming concepts (such as variables and control flow) within a client-server context without being bogged down in complex or abstract constructs. Laboratory exercises expose students to a range of real-world problems with a view of motivating computational thinking and grounding the material covered in lecture. Prerequisites: One of (1)-(3) below must be met: (1) (New high school curriculum): One 4U Math course with a grade of at least 75%. (2) Completion of six credits from York University MATH courses (not including courses with second digit 5) with a GPA of 5.00 or better over these credits; (3) Completion of six credits from York University mathematics courses whose second digit is 5, with an average grade not below 7.00 (B+).

        "description": "This course is an introduction to the concepts and tools of computer science as students learn a procedural subset of the Python programming language. Python has a variety of libraries in different domains allowing for the solution of interesting problems which has made it a popular language in industry and the academy. Students do hands-on work to design, write, debug and test computer programs that solve problems computationally. Students study variables, assignments, expressions (arithmetic, relational and logical) and sequencing of statements to implement solutions for computational problems, in Python. They document programs with comments and preconditions. They analyze the type correctness of programs via a type checker. They use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop, unit-test and debug programs given a problem specification. They apply conditionals (including nested conditionals) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code functions to develop modular programming solutions for computational problems. They apply Python loops (including nested loops) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They apply data structures, including tuples, sets, lists and dictionaries, to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code simple recursive functions to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. Prerequisites: One of (1)-(3) below must be met: (1) (New high school curriculum): One 4U Math course with a grade of at least 75%. (2) Completion of six credits from York University MATH courses (not including courses with second digit 5) with a GPA of 5.00 or better over these credits; (3) Completion of six credits from York University mathematics courses whose second digit is 5, with an average grade not below 7.00 (B+).",

Previously offered as: LE/CSE 2011 3.00. The course discusses the fundamental data structures commonly used in the design of algorithms. Abstract operations on data structures are specified using pre and post conditions and/or system invariants. Trade-offs between a number of different implementations of each abstract data types (ADT) are analyzed. Each algorithm operating on data structures is proved correct using loop invariants or induction. Both formal and informal proofs are introduced though most of the reasoning is done informally. Data structures are coded and unit tested in an object-oriented language. Selecting the appropriate ADT and a suitable implementation depending on the application is covered.
